# üí´ About Me:
I completed my studies at UCSD in 2020 with a major in Cognitive Science and a minor in Computer Science. Before my graduation, I undertook multiple software development internships, gaining experience across diverse platforms and programming languages. While I initially anticipated a transition into the industry post-graduation, I was presented with a unique opportunity to join the Yates Lab as a technician. This experience ignited a passion for research, diverting my initial plans towards the industry.

Despite my lack of formal education in biology or chemistry, I immersed myself in proteomics and mass spectrometry. To bridge the knowledge gap, I continued as a technician post-graduation, supplementing my education with life science courses and even some graduate classes at Scripps. With a strengthened foundation, I was admitted to the Scaggs Graduate program in 2021. I'm set to complete my studies in 2025, after which I aim to transition to the industry, ideally within the proteomics domain.

My research primarily involves developing open-source software tailored for mass spectrometry data analysis. More specifically, my areas of expertise include real-time search, predicting protein/peptide molecular properties via machine learning, and crafting ad hoc algorithms.
